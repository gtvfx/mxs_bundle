# mxs_bundle
This is a deployable Maxscript bundle with a module management system
that comes with several libraries that I will be extending as I'm able.

The setup relies on Environment variables that I'm currently setting with
a Batch file that sets up the environment and then Launches 3dsmax.

This file (MaxLauncher.bat) will need to be updated with paths for your
local setup.

A Tab Menu is automatically generated that will appear above the viewport. This menu system
is programatically populated by directory and file structure so you can easily extend and populate 
the tabs for your own use. Documentation to come...

More to come...
