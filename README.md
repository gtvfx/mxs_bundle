# mxs_bundle
This is a deployable Maxscript bundle with a module management system
that comes with several libraries that I will be extending as I'm able.

The setup relies on Environment variables that I'm currently setting with
a Batch file that sets up the environment and then Launches 3dsmax.

This file (MaxLauncher.bat) will need to be updated with paths for your
local setup.

More to come...
